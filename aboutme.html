      <p>Hi, my name is Marisa Cunha, I'm Portuguese and I've lived in Switzerland for 17 years. I'm married, I have 1 daughter and 2 cats.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Portugal in the city of Setúbal, a beautiful fishing village about 30kms from Lisbon, with good food, people and 
         stunning beaches (considered one of the most beautiful bays in the world). I now live in Romanshorn, which is also a port city, by the wonderful lake Bodensee in Switzerland.
      </p><br>
      <p>In my free time I like spending time in nature while I'm riding my bike. 
        I love to read (I have lots of books, about very diferent subjects, I'm a self-taught!), I love to swim underneath a beautiful shinny sky and doing Thai-Chi at least 1x per week. I would like to practice it more often, because I think thats important to keep the balance of your body, mind and soul.
       </p><br>
      <p>In my professional and academic trajectory, I have experienced very different areas: from agriculture,
        production, quality control to materials management.
      </p><br>
      <p>In 2018 I decided to go back to school and since then I haven't stopped feeding my need to learn.
        And it was when I started studying again (Handelsdiplom VSH) that I discovered my passion for 
        programming at the same time, through a mobile game (MIMO, available on the Play Store). When I 
        finished the course, it was difficult to decide if I would continue my studies in the same area or if I
        would take programming seriously. But I was always sure of one thing: I won't stay still.
        So I decided to dedicate myself to what I really liked and started to learn to program, at home, with 
        the help of several online courses that currently exist and some good books.
        After acquiring the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I am now in the final phase of the Web Design for Everyone course: Web Development Basics and Coding Specialization - Capstone
        Web Design for Everyone course: Web Development Basics and Coding Specialization - Capstone 
        Project. And this project is precisely this portfolio. When I finish the course I want to participate in 
        several projects to gain experience and I will publish them here on my personal page.
